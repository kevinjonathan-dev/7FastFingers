# 7fastfingers
10fastfingers is not perfect, but it's still my favourite typing test app by far. 7fastfingers aims to solve all the problems I have with 10fastfingers, creating the ideal typing test for me. I only use 7 fingers to type anyway. 

## Installation
git clone\
cd 7fastfingers\
npm run dev/yarn start
