# 7fastfingers
A simple typing test app that allows you to set the test duration. Heavily inspired by 10fastfingers, my favourite typing test app by far. 7fastfingers aims to solve all the problems I have with 10fastfingers, creating the ideal typing test for me. Also, I only use 7 fingers to type. Built with React.js. Wordlist contains 100 most used words in English

## Installation

## Features
